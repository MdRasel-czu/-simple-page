        <p>The University of Emperial was established by Royal Charter in 1836 for the public benefit and is recognised globally. Throughout our long history, the University has offered access to a wide range of academic opportunities. As a world leader in higher education, the University has pioneered change in the sector. We were the first university to admit students regardless of their gender, race or religion, the first to admit women to degree programmes and, in 1865, the first to give students the opportunity to study wherever they are, providing access to higher education across the globe. For almost 200 years, we have improved the lives of millions of people around the world through our unique approach to education, prompting Charles Dickens to term us the 'People's University'./p>
